## üìù Notes

- **Power Management**: Ensure proper regulation of voltage from solar panel and battery using TP4056.
- **Sensor Calibration**: Calibrate the soil and light sensors for more accurate environmental readings.
- **Safety**: Always test the solar charging circuit in a controlled environment to avoid overcharging.
